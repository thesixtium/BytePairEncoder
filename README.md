# BytePairEncoder

## Description
This project is a personal project to try and make a byte pair encoder and decoder.
The goal is to make long strings of text smaller by replacing long strings by shorter strings. 

### What It Does
This program encodes and decodes long strings to try and save memory space.

### Technologies Used
The main technology used was Java with no extra imports.

## Installation
This project can be used like any other Java classes.

## Usage
I would recommend not using this encoder as there are far more efficient models.
